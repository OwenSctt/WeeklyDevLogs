## 🧮 **Algorithm Practice - NeetCode Solutions**

### **Solutions Added This Week:**

#### **Array Problems:**
- ✅ **Contains Duplicate** - Easy
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Solution: Hash set for O(1) lookup, includes alternative sorting approach
  - Alternative: O(n log n) time with O(1) space using sorting

#### **String Problems:**
- ✅ **Valid Anagram** - Easy
  - Time Complexity: O(n log n)
  - Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Solution: Character frequency comparison using sorting

- ✅ **Group Anagrams** - Medium
  - Time Complexity: O(n * m log m)
  - Space Complexity: O(n * m)
  - Solution: Hash map with sorted strings as keys

#### **Heap Problems:**
- ✅ **Top K Frequent Elements** - Medium
  - Time Complexity: O(n)
  - Space Complexity: O(n)
  - Solution: Bucket sort approach for optimal performance
